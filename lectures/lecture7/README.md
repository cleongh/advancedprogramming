# Lecture 6: Randomized algorithms

- Montecarlo: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm
    - running time is deterministic, output is not.
    - one-sided vs. two-sided error (for instance false is always correct whereas true might be 
      incorrect).

    - output is deterministic, running time is not.

# Exercises

- your algorithm must use (or have a version that uses) a randomized algorithm

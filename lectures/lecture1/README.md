# Exercise

- upload a project to github
- must include a makefile
- must include a cmake file
- must be automatically indented
- must be well documented
- cmake + make must build everything including documentation (name Makefile so that it doesn't 
  interfere with the one generated by Cmake).
- they must find out how to tell cmake create doxygen documentation
- make all projects be available on github
- create an account in stackoverflow if you don't have one yet.
